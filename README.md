# SpyglassControls

SpyglassControls is my first (useful) mod I created when I realized how bad the spyglass is implemented in MC.
So this mod aims to fix that!

## Features:

* Completely client-side
* Lightweight
* Smooth spyglass movement, similar to the Optifine zoom
* (Yeah, that's all for now, I plan to add more)

## Versions and compatibility

* Fabric
* 1.19.X
